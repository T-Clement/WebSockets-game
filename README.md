This project is a simple mutliplayer countdown game to **learn WebSockets**.

The server send a random number and the user need to stop his countdown the closest to number send by the server.

My main goal is to be able to render in real time the state of the game to all the users connected,
taking the inputs of players and broadcast to players who is the winner.

If I move forward quickly on the project, I'm thinking of integrating a room system
so that certain groups of players can play games with each other.
